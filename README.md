# Credit Card Marketing Mix Modeling & ROI Analysis

## Overview  
This project analyzes the effectiveness of various digital marketing channels in driving credit card approvals using **Marketing Mix Modeling (MMM)**. By leveraging historical spend and approval data, we build regression models to quantify each channelâ€™s ROI and provide actionable insights for optimized budget allocation.

## Problem Statement  
Financial institutions face challenges in accurately measuring the impact of marketing spend across channels, leading to inefficient budget allocation and higher acquisition costs.

## What We Did  
- Simulated credit card acquisition funnel data (Starts, Submits, Approvals) and channel spend  
- Visualized funnel conversion rates by marketing channel  
- Built simple and multi-channel MMM regression models to estimate the impact of spend on approvals  
- Quantified ROI per channel using model coefficients  
- Compared actual vs predicted approvals to evaluate model fit

## Key Insights  
- **Shopping Cart** and **Checkout** channels deliver the highest ROI (~38.4% combined impact)  
- Channels like **Home Page** and **Email Marketing** have lower marginal impact and may require optimization  
- Model highlights opportunities to reallocate budget toward high-performing channels

## Business Impact  
Enables data-driven decisions for marketing budget allocation, maximizing approved credit card applications while minimizing cost.

## Tech Stack  
- Python (pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn)  
- Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab
